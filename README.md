# Secured Web Addressability Network (SWAN) UI Design

Hello! :wave:

You are reading about a reference user interface design for a modern consent management solution.

The UX and UI design was created by [Dot Creative Digital Agency](https://dotcreative.hu) after testing and re-thinking the demo of SWAN. The aim was to create a cookie compilance that was both familiar for the users and innovative. It was important to us make the consent managemet aesthetically pleasing, not ostentatious, and to be able to easily integrate it into any website.

In future developments, the design guideline will help to maintain a consistent and stable look for SWAN.
